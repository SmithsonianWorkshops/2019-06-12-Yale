  <a href='https://carpentries.org/'>The Carpentries</a> (comprised of <a href='https://datacarpentry.org/'>
  Data Carpentry</a>, <a href='https://librarycarpentry.org/'>Library Carpentry</a>, and 
  <a href='https://software-carpentry.org/'>Software Carpentry</a>) 
  is a project whose mission is to teach foundational computational and data science skills 
  to researchers and others who create, manage, and use data. Specifically, Data Carpentry 
  lessons are designed to be picked up by learners who do not have any previous programming 
  experience. Data Carpentry workshops are typically organized in a 2-day format, but we will 
  compress the lessons in this workshop to 1 day to focus on learning Python and Jupyter notebooks 
  to work with data files in a reproducible manner. Before covering Python, we will go through 
  a lesson using Excel to learn about the "tidy data" format, and best practices for working 
  with tabular data files. We will also spend some time discussing community-building around 
  the Carpentries, and how we can partner together to build biodiversity data science literacy 
  at our organizations.
  Participants will be encouraged to help one another
  and to apply what they have learned to their own research problems.
